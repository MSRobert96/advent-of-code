About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl][aoc-eric], and is
100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here][aoc-support].


About this repo
---------------

I discovered Advent of Code in 2018, but played my first edition in 2022. In
this repository you can find my solutions for the puzzles as well as other 
miscellaneus stuff like utility scripts.

In each year's folder you will find:

- `inputs/`: my puzzle inputs.
- `solutions/`: my solutions for the puzzles. I usually rewrite, polish and
   optimize my original solutions.
